# Data Sources

All the datasets about Ops 

Datasources: Metabase (itâ€™s actually an interface): connects to postgresql DB. Contains users info and also hubspot integration info Mixpanel: events analytics platform. Shows interactions of users inside the webapp. Ideally, we need to move this info to a database, so that we can query it via SQL BigQuery: contains projects with datasets, and each dataset with different tables with ops info
